### serviceWorker.js
 This optional code is used to register a service worker.
 Register() is not called by default.
 This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives it offline capabilities.    However, it also means that developers (and users) will only see deployed updates on subsequent visits to a page, after all the existing tabs open on the page have been closed, since previously cached resources are updated in the background.
